This is for Lab 4. It is a bike repair shop called "Alex Cycle Shop".  It was created with Bootstrap 5.

The site allows users to book different services and see the prices of those services.  The workflow is clear to the user.  The user can start the booking by selecting a service, then picking a date and time and including their contact info.  After that, they are able to confirm their booking and a modal pops up to confirm their booking.
